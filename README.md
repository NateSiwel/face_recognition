# Features
* Detects faces in real time using pre-trained caffe model
* Extracts face embeddings using pre-trained pytorch model
* Trains an SVM classifier based on a dataset of known faces
* Recognizes faces in real time from webcam or other video, displaying name and confidence score 

# Dependencies
* Python 3.x
* OpenCV
* NumPy
* imutils
* scikit-learn

# TODO 
* Implement face alignment before fetching embeddings
